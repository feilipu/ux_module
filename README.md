# User Experience Module

User Experience Module is designed to use with the RC2014.

It provides a VGA output, and PS/2 keyboard input. It also provides a FTDI Basic serial emulation.

It is designed to operate as an MC65B50 ACIA device (the standard RC2014 Serial Module), so that it can be used without modifying the standard ROMs in circulation.
